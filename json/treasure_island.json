The first one of these items is initially owned by a blind fellow who is killed by trampling horses after the narrator guides him to a boarder who has only paid one week worth of his rent. A villain chastises people loyal to George Merry for impiety when they make one of these items from the pages of Dick Johnson’s Bible. One of these items induces a stroke in a man who is freeloading off of the Admiral Benbow Inn, which is run by the narrator’s family. A map indicating Captain Flint’s cache saves a man from the punishment incurred from one of these items, thereby preventing a mutiny against John Silver.
