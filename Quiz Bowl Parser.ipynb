      "Geronimo\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Geronimo (Mescalero-Chiricahua: Goyaałé, Athabaskan pronunciation: [kòjàːɬɛ́], lit. 'the one who yawns'; June 16, 1829 – February 17, 1909) was a leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Ndendahe Apache people. From 1850 to 1886, Geronimo joined with members of three other Central Apache bands –  the Tchihende, the Tsokanende (called Chiricahua by Americans) and the Nednhi – to carry out numerous raids, as well as fight against Mexican and U.S. military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Sonora and in the southwestern American territories of New Mexico and Arizona.\n",
      "Geronimo's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache–United States conflict, which started with the American invasion of Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848. Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people, and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life. Geronimo led breakouts from the reservations in attempts to return his people to their previous nomadic lifestyle. During Geronimo's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886, he surrendered three times and eventually accepted life on the Apache reservations. While well-known, Geronimo was not a chief of the Bedonkohe band of the Central Apache but a shaman, as was Nokay-doklini among the Western Apache. However, since he was a superb leader in raiding and warfare, he frequently led large numbers of 30 to 50 Apache men.In 1886, after an intense pursuit in northern Mexico by American forces that followed Geronimo's third 1885 reservation breakout, Geronimo surrendered for the last time to Lt. Charles Bare Gatewood. Geronimo and 27 other Apaches were later sent to join the rest of the Chiricahua tribe, which had been previously exiled to Florida. While holding him as a prisoner, the United States capitalized on Geronimo’s fame among non-Indians by displaying him at various fairs and exhibitions. In 1898, for example, Geronimo was exhibited at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha, Nebraska; seven years later, the Indian Office provided Geronimo for use in a parade at the second inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt. He died at the Fort Sill hospital in 1909, as a prisoner of war, and was buried at the Fort Sill Indian Agency Cemetery, among the graves of relatives and other Apache prisoners of war.\n",

      "The Apache ( ə-PATCH-ee) are a group of culturally related Native American tribes in the Southwestern United States, which include the  Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Mimbreño, Ndendahe (Bedonkohe or Mogollon and Nednhi or Carrizaleño and Janero), Salinero, Plains (Kataka or Semat or \"Kiowa-Apache\") and Western Apache (Aravaipa, Pinaleño, Coyotero, Tonto). Distant cousins of the Apache are the Navajo, with whom they share the Southern Athabaskan languages. There are Apache communities in Oklahoma and Texas, and reservations in Arizona and New Mexico. Apache people have moved throughout the United States and elsewhere, including urban centers. The Apache Nations are politically autonomous, speak several different languages, and have distinct cultures.\n",
      "Historically, the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern Great Plains, including areas in what is now Eastern Arizona, Northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) and New Mexico, West Texas, and Southern Colorado. These areas are collectively known as Apacheria.\n",
      "The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century.  In 19th-century confrontations during the American Indian Wars, the U.S. Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "APACHE is the collective term for several culturally related groups of Native Americans resident in the Southwest United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "11: The current division of APACHEan groups includes the Western APACHE, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan and Plains APACHE (formerly Kiowa-APACHE).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12: The first APACHE raids on Sonora and Chihuahua took place in the late 17th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13: To counter the early APACHE raids on Spanish settlements, presidios were established at Janos (1685) in Chihuahua and at Fronteras (1690) in what is now northeastern Sonora, then Opata country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14: In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on APACHE scalps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15: APACHE raids on Mexican villages were so numerous and brutal that no area was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16: Between 1820 and 1835 alone, some 5,000 Mexicans died in APACHE raids, and 100 settlements were destroyed.During the decades of APACHE-Mexican and APACHE-United States conflicts, raiding had become embedded in the APACHE way of life, used for strategic purposes as well as economic enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17: Speaking of the start of the Spanish/Mexican APACHE conflict, Debo states, \"Thus the APACHEs were driven into the mountains and raiding the settled communities became a way of life for them, an economic enterprise as legitimate as gathering berries or hunting deer...\" and often there was overlap between raids for economic need and warfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18: Mexicans and Americans responded with retaliatory attacks against the APACHE which were no less violent and were very seldom limited to identified individual adult enemies, much like the APACHE raids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19: The raiding and retaliation fed the fires of a virulent revenge warfare that reverberated back and forth between APACHEs and Mexicans and later, APACHEs and Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20: From 1850 to 1886, Geronimo, as well as other APACHE leaders, conducted attacks, but Geronimo was driven by a desire to take revenge for the murder of his family by Mexican soldiers and accumulated a record of brutality during this time that was unmatched by any of his contemporaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21: While respected as a skilled and effective leader of raids or warfare, he emerges as not very likable, and he was not widely popular among the other APACHEs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22: This was primarily because he refused to give in to American government demands, causing some APACHEs to fear the American response.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23: Nevertheless, the APACHE people stood in awe of Geronimo's powers, which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "24: These powers indicated to other APACHEs that Geronimo had supernatural gifts that he could use for good or ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25: In eyewitness accounts by other APACHEs, Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened, and he was able to anticipate future events.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26:  He also demonstrated powers to heal other APACHEs.\n",

      "Biography\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "Geronimo was born to the Bedonkohe band of the APACHE near Turkey Creek, a tributary of the Gila River in the modern-day state of New Mexico, then part of Mexico, though the APACHE disputed Mexico's claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "28: His grandfather, Mahko, had been chief of the Bedonkohe APACHE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "29: He had three brothers and four sisters.His parents raised him according to APACHE traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30: Geronimo married a woman named Alope, from the Nedni-Chiricahua band of APACHE, when he was 17; they had three children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "31: \n",
      "Massacre at Janos\n",
      "On March 5, 1851, a company of 400 Mexican soldiers from Sonora led by Colonel José María Carrasco attacked Geronimo's camp outside Janos (Kas-Ki-Yeh in APACHE) while the men were in town trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "32: Carrasco claimed he had followed the APACHEs to Janos, Chihuahua, after they had conducted a raid in Sonora, taken livestock and other plunder and badly defeated Mexican militia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "33: In December 1860, 30 miners began a surprise attack on an encampment of Bedonkohes APACHEs on the west bank of the Mimbres River.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "34: killed four Indians, wounded others, and captured thirteen women and children.\" Attacks by the APACHE again followed, with raids against U.S. citizens and property.In 1873 the Mexicans once again attacked the APACHE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35: After months of fighting in the mountains, the APACHEs and Mexicans decided on a peace treaty at Casas Grandes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36: After terms were agreed, the Mexican troops gave mezcal to the APACHEs, and while they were intoxicated, they attacked and killed 20 APACHEs and captured some.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37: The APACHE were forced to retreat into the mountains once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38: Moreover, there are many stories of this type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other APACHEs entered to escape troops but were not seen exiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39: \n",
      "Geronimo campaign\n",
      "The APACHE–United States conflict was a direct outgrowth of the much older APACHE–Mexican conflict which had been ongoing in the same general area since the beginning of Mexican/Spanish settlement during the 17th century.While APACHEs were shielded from the violence of warfare on the reservation, disability and death from diseases like malaria were much more prevalent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "40: Rebelling against reservation life, other APACHE leaders had led their bands in \"breakouts\" from the reservations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41: The APACHE knew the rough terrain of the Sierras intimately, which helped them elude pursuit and protected them from attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42: The Sierra Madre mountains lie on the border between the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, which allowed the APACHE access to raid and plunder the small villages, haciendas, wagon trains, worker camps and travelers in both states.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43: From Mexico, APACHE bands also staged surprise raids back into the United States, often seeking to replenish their supply of guns and ammunition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "44: In these raids into the United States, the APACHEs moved swiftly and attacked isolated ranches, wagon trains, prospectors and travelers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45: They often killed all the persons they encountered in order to avoid detection and pursuit as long as possible before they slipped back over the border into Mexico.The \"breakouts\" and the subsequent resumption of APACHE raiding and warfare caused the Mexican Army and militia as well as United States forces to pursue and attempt to kill or apprehend off-reservation \"renegade\" APACHE bands, including Geronimo's, wherever they could be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46: Because the Mexican army and militia units of Sonora and Chihuahua were unable to suppress the several Chiricahua bands based in the Sierra Madre mountains, in 1883 Mexico allowed the United States to send troops into Mexico to continue their pursuit of Geronimo's band and the bands of other APACHE leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "47: \n",
      "On May 17, 1885, a number of APACHE including Nana, Mangus (son of Mangas Coloradas), Chihuahua, Naiche, Geronimo, and their followers fled the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona after a show of force against the reservation's commanding officer Britton Davis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48: Each was composed of a troop of cavalry (usually about forty men) and about 100 APACHE Scouts recruited from among the APACHE people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "49: These APACHE units proved effective in finding the mountain strongholds of the APACHE bands, and killing or capturing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "50: They pursued the APACHE through the summer and autumn through Mexican Chihuahua and back across the border into the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "51: The APACHE continually raided settlements, murdering other innocent Native Americans and civilians and stealing horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "52: Over time this persistent pursuit by both Mexican and American forces discouraged Geronimo and other similar APACHE leaders, and caused a steady and irreplaceable attrition of the members of their bands, which taken all together eroded their will to resist and led to their ultimate capitulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "53: His APACHE Scouts attacked the next morning and captured the APACHE's herd of horses and their camp equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "54: The APACHEs were demoralized and agreed to negotiate for surrender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "55: Before the negotiations could be concluded, Mexican troops arrived and mistook the APACHE Scouts for the enemy APACHE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "56: Fly took about 15 exposures of the APACHE on 8 by 10 inches (200 by 250 mm) glass negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "57: His photos of Geronimo and the other free APACHEs, taken on March 25 and 26, are the only known photographs taken of an American Indian while still at war with the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "58: Geronimo gave Gatewood credit for his decision to surrender as Gatewood was well known to Geronimo, spoke some APACHE, and was familiar with and honored their traditions and values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "59: He acknowledged Lawton's tenacity for wearing the APACHEs down with constant pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "60: Completely worn out, the small band of APACHEs returned to the U.S. with Lawton and officially surrendered to General Miles on September 4, 1886, at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona.When Geronimo surrendered, he had in his possession a Winchester Model 1876 lever-action rifle with a silver-washed barrel and receiver, bearing Serial Number 109450.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "61: \n",
      "Prisoner of war\n",
      "Geronimo and other APACHEs, including the APACHE Scouts who had helped the Army track him down, were sent as prisoners to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "62: This prompt action prevented the Arizona civil authorities from intervening to arrest and try Geronimo for the death of the many Americans who had been killed during the previous decades of raiding.\"In that alien climate,\" The Washington Post reported, \"the APACHE died 'like flies at frost time.' Businessmen there soon had the idea to have Geronimo serve as a tourist attraction, and hundreds of visitors daily were let into the fort to lay eyes on the 'bloodthirsty' Indian in his cell.\" While the prisoners of war were in Florida, the government relocated hundreds of their children from their Arizona reservation to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "65: Visitors came to see how the \"savage\" had been \"tamed,\" and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious APACHE \"chief.\" (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money in his pockets and allowed him to travel though never without government guards.\n",

It is the 6th-largest and the 14th-most-populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is part of the Four Corners region with Utah to the north, Colorado to the northeast, and New Mexico to the east; its other neighboring states are Nevada to the northwest, California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest.\n",
      "Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.\n",
      "Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Sunrise, and Tucson. In addition to the internationally known Grand Canyon National Park, which is one of the world's seven natural wonders, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments.\n",
      "Arizona's population and economy have grown dramatically since the 1950s because of inward migration, and the state is now a major hub of the Sun Belt. Cities such as Phoenix and Tucson have developed large, sprawling suburban areas. Many large companies, such as PetSmart and Circle K, have headquarters in the state, and Arizona is home to major universities, including the University of Arizona and Arizona State University. The state is known for a history of conservative politicians such as Barry Goldwater and John McCain, though it has become a swing state since the 1990s.\n",
      "Arizona is home to a diverse population. About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Since the 1980s, the proportion of Hispanics in the state's population has grown significantly owing to migration from Mexico. A substantial portion of the population are followers of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n",
